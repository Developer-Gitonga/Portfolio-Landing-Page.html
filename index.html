      Hi there! Coding is soo good, right? <br>
      If so, follow me... I am currently an enthusiastic developer beginning his journey. And this is my story...<br>
      Going ahead I am looking forward to growing with the young IT industry that has innumerable potential in the near and distant future.<br>
      As such I am looking to express my ideas through software design and help grow an ever expanding database.<br>
      Still finding my feet, so not getting carried away, but I certainly enjoy when I run a code and it works :)<br>

      Since you are already here, have a look at a few of my projects and be sure to give me a thumbs up if you like any of them! Of course comments are allowed.<br>
